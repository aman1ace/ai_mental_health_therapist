AI Mental Health Therapist
This project is an AI-powered mental health chatbot providing empathetic,
supportive text responses. Users can share their thoughts, and the system detects
emotions to offer guidance. The frontend uses Streamlit for chat interface, while
FastAPI handles backend requests. Groq LLM and Ollama MedGemma models
generate calm, therapeutic replies. An optional Twilio API can trigger emergency calls
for severe distress. The system processes requests in real-time without storing data.
Accuracy is evaluated qualitatively based on response relevance and emotional
alignment. This project aids mental wellness but cannot replace professional therapy.
